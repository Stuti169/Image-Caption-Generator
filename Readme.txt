Improving Image Caption Generators

Description:-

This project aims to enhance image caption generators, which describe images in natural language. These tools can be used in assistive technology, image search, and virtual assistants. However, they currently face challenges such as inaccuracy, slow processing, and bias.

Key Improvements:-

Better Accuracy and Coherence:

Use larger, more diverse datasets.
Implement more powerful models like Transformers and GRUs.
Faster Processing:

Optimize model architectures and algorithms.
Reduce Bias:

Apply techniques to make captions fair and unbiased.
Advanced Techniques:

Use attention mechanisms and reinforcement learning to focus on important parts of images.
Future Goals
With continued research and development, these enhancements will make image caption generators more accurate, efficient, and fair, leading to innovative applications in various fields.
